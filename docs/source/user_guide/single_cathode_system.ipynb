    "This guide describes how to set up an exemplary single-cathode system programmatically. *SIMTRA* allows the definition of a sputter system from basic 3D geometries like circles, rectangles, cylinders and cones. Generally, a sputter system always consists of a chamber, one (or multiple) magnetron(s) and one (or multiple) dummy object(s). "

Its geometry is defined via a `DummyObject`, which needs to be built from individual surfaces. Here, we build a standard axialsymmetric magnetron with a circular target from two circles, a cylinder and a cone. Every 3D object (`Surface` or `DummyObject`) always needs to have a position and orientation. If none are defined, it is assumed that `position=(0, 0, 0)` and `orientation=(0, 0, 0)`. When defining the `Magnetron` object, the index of the surface to sputter from needs to be defined via the `sputter_surface_index parameter`. Note here that this value starts at 1 (in contrast to the Python standard) in order to be consistent with *SIMTRA*. "
