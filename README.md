# pySIMTRA

`pySIMTRA` is a Python wrapper for `SIMTRA` (<ins>Si</ins>mulation of <ins>M</ins>etal <ins>Tra</ins>nsport), a Monte 
Carlo code for simulating the transport of sputtered atoms through the gas phase<sup>1,2</sup>. SIMTRA allows for the 
definition of custom sputter systems in 3D by a graphical user interface and does not only calculate the deposition 
profile, but also properties of the deposited atoms such as energy and direction. pySIMTRA extends this functionality by 
allowing to define custom systems programmatically via code but most importantly enables the simulation of co-sputtering
experiments through the parallel execution of the SIMTRA simulations with multithreading.

The package is part of a scientific publication *A Python-Based Approach to Sputter Deposition Simulations in 
Combinatorial Materials Science* which can be found here:
